  <h1>POST - 2018 Oscars Best Dressed Men</h1>
  <p>For many of us fashion lovers, The Oscars is an annual parade of magazine editorial looks that we use to reflect on for years on end. Here at 9Tailors, we relish the opportunity to inform our clients about what's &quot;new and noteworthy&quot; in men's fashion. If we learned anything from this year's Oscars it's that <strong>velvet is in</strong>, <strong>plain</strong> <strong>black tuxedos are out</strong>, and <strong>matching is so <em>blasé</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Take a cue from our top picks for Best Dressed Men and dare to stand out like these fashion A'listers:</p>
<h6><strong>Ansel Elgort in Tom Ford</strong></h6>
<p>Ansel Elgort knocked this look out of the park. If anyone was able to pull off a bottle green velvet tuxedo jacket, it was this young man right here. We especially love that he decided to go with a non-matching pant, making the look extra modern.</p>

<h6><strong>Chadwick Boseman in Givenchy Haute Couture</strong></h6>
<p>We give major props to Mr. Boseman for bringing on the glam factor and daring to take a major risk in this Givenchy embroidered knee length jacket. His risk was well worth it as we cannot stop gushing over this look. Part <em>Matrix,</em> part Michael Jackson &quot;Thriller&quot; there's nothing basic about this look!</p>

<h6><strong>Lakeith Stanfield in Ermenegildo Zegna Couture</strong></h6>
<p>Upon first glance, one would never guess that Lakeith's suit is produced from sustainable silk, but this eco-friendly number proves that fashion can be green _and _non-hipster looking. Lakeith rocks his steel blue suit impeccably well, adding a silver broach on his lapel for extra pizzazz.</p>

<h6><strong>Common in Giorgio Armani</strong></h6>
<p>Common is a pro in keeping things simple and elegant. His made-to-measure Armani tuxedo is no exception here. Dressing well is all about proper fit and this suit FITS. While charcoal isn't exactly pushing the envelope, the velvet lapel, bow tie, and shoes keep things just interesting enough.</p>

<h6><strong>Oscar Isaac in ISAIA</strong></h6>
<p>Oscar looks mighty sophisticated and sleek in this made-to-measure velvet tuxedo by ISAIA. We are glad that he left a little facial stubble--otherwise he would look <em>too</em> pretty.</p>
